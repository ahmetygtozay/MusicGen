# MusicGen
A generative music model for creating unique audio tracks using machine learning techniques.
Overview
MusicGen is a project designed to generate music tracks programmatically. It leverages machine learning algorithms to produce creative and diverse musical compositions. This repository contains the source code, sample datasets, and instructions to set up and experiment with the MusicGen model.
Features

 Music Generation: Create original music tracks based on trained models.
 Customizable Parameters: Adjust hyperparameters to influence style and complexity of generated music.
 Sample Datasets: Includes sample datasets for training and testing the model.
 Easy to Extend: Modular codebase allows for adding new features or preprocessing techniques.

# Installation
````
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/ahmetygtozay/MusicGen.git
cd MusicGen

````
Install Dependencies:Ensure you have Python installed (3.8 recommended). Install required packages using pip:
````
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
````

Download Datasets (Optional) If using provided sample datasets, download them from [link to dataset] and place in the data/ folder.


Usage

Train the Model:Run the training script to train MusicGen on your dataset:
````
python3 train.py --dataset_path data/ --output_dir models/
````

Generate Music:Use the trained model to generate new music tracks:
````
python3 generate.py --model_path models/trained_model.pth --output_dir output/
````

Customize Parameters:Modify config.yaml to adjust hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, or music length.
